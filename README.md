# Portfolio

## Description

I built this webpage to display my skills and talents by showcasing a portfolio of my projects that highlights my best work and processes.

This will help prospective employers to review my work skills and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position.

By building this webpage, I was able to further apply advanced CSS skills learned from bootcamp to create this webpage which will be used in my job search.
